## hey, 👋

after several years working at a fintech (acquired) as a researcher, product manager and marketing director i'm learning software development. 🧑‍💻

i'm taking a few online classes and building small projects for experience.

run100miles and tradingbuddy are my most complete projects though they will always be evolving. thanks for stopping by and enjoy!
