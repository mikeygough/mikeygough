## hey, 👋

after several years working at a fintech (acquired) as a researcher, product manager and marketing director i'm learning software development. 🧑‍💻

i'm taking a few online classes and building small projects for experience. run100miles and tradingbuddy are my most complete projects though they will always be evolving. thanks for stopping by and enjoy!

as of august 2023 i'll be joining shopify as a dev degree intern. i'll work part-time as a developer while earning a computer science degree at dominican university of california.
