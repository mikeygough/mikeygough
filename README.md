## hey, there! 👋

### backstory 📚
after several years working in finance as a researcher, product manager and marketing director i'm taking some time off to try something new! 🧑‍💻

### next steps 👣
from aug 2022 through march 2023 i'm learning as much as i can about programming! [github](https://github.com/mikeygough) is where you can follow along on my projects & progress!


### the curriculum i've laid out for myself looks like this:

#### [CS50X](https://bit.ly/3TD8gFk)
an introductory computer science course at Harvard that teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. the course is ten weeks and consists of weekly lectures and problem sets, ultimately culminating in a final project (that i'm still working on, peep [discogskiii](https://github.com/mikeygough/discogskiii)). the course covered the topics listed below but by no means do i claim to be an expert in them, just have some exposure!
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Algorithms</li>
  <li>Memory</li>
  <li>Data Structures</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS & Javascript</li>
  <li>Flask</li>
</ul>

#### [CS50P](https://bit.ly/3VOYzpd)
an introductory python programming course that teaches students how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. ten weeks with weekly lectures and problem sets with a final project (i will finish discogskii before starting this final project). my idea for a final project is a financial report generator. pull data from a financial endpoint such as IEX, generate plots and statistics, then write that to a pdf with a module such as fpdf2.
<ul>
  <li>Functions, Variables</li>
  <li>Conditionals</li>
  <li>Loops</li>
  <li>Exceptions</li>
  <li>Libraries</li>
